# What is it about ?

Well, this game is about an RPG combat where the user is going to fight with the bots or enemy with artificial intelligence where there is going to be a great battle, the player is going to have different powers, not the same as the enemy, it is by turn where the user or player will have 3 characters and will fight with 3 enemies with different powers

# What did I do

# Well, why did I make this video game?

I did it to gain experience in the game engine called UNITY and also to have more programming experience to make better games in the future

# I'm going to briefly explain the game I made

In this RPG combat with 3 characters and 3 enemies that you have to kill to win, it is a 3v3 where players have powers such as:
Heal (Helps heal teammates adds 8 life)
Slash (It is a melee power where it takes 8 life from the enemy, not all but the one you select)
Fireball (It is a fireball that removes 3 life from the enemy and leaves a burning effect for 3 turns and removes 5 life from the enemy).

Now the powers of the enemies are:
Heal (Helps heal his teammates who are his allies (Enemies) and adds 5 life to his teammates)
DarkWaterBall (It is a ball of dark water that takes 3 life from the player and has a burning effect of 3 turns, a damage of 5 life to the player per turn)
Rock(A ball of rock that deals 8 life damage to the player), Blow(It's a melee power that deals 8 life damage to the player)
