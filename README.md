# What did I do

# Well, why did I make this video game?

I did it to gain experience in the game engine called UNITY and also to have more programming experience to make better games in the future

# I'm going to briefly explain the game I made

In this RPG combat with 3 characters and 3 enemies that you have to kill to win, it is a 3v3 where players have powers such as:
Heal (Helps heal teammates adds 8 life)
Slash (It is a melee power where it takes 8 life from the enemy, not all but the one you select)
Fireball (It is a fireball that removes 3 life from the enemy and leaves a burning effect for 3 turns and removes 5 life from the enemy).

Now the powers of the enemies are:
